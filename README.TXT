ALERT !!! NEVER USES CRYPTOGRAPHY ROUTINES CREATED BY OURSELVES. 
PLEASE USE CHECKED LIBRARIES AS OPENSSL.

ANOTHER ALERT !!! THE IMPLEMENTATIONS AND DEMONSTRATIONS ARE ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, THEY ARE NOT SAFE FOR SERIOUS USAGE.


LAST ALERT !!!  THE FIRST ALERT IS NOT SUITABLE IF YOU WORK IMPLEMENTING CRYPTOGRAPHIES ROUTINES IN A FAMOUS LIBRARY E.G. OPENSSL 


Created in order to understand and apply cryptography

crypto_notations:

i )  Fields_and_aes - notes from "undestanding cryptography" also perform 1 round of AES.

ii)  hash_func      - notes regarding hash function from "undestanding cryptography"

iii) PKE            - notes related with Public Key Encryption

implementation:

i)   proof         : A implementation of some algorithms with  small number just to see it happens, not suitable for real case
ii)  imlementation : real implementations with educational purpouses. 

python_Teste: 

i)   Scripts to perform some crypto operation using a python library for that
